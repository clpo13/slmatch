# slmatch

Test [S-Lang][slang] regex matching on an arbitrary string. Useful for testing patterns to put in your
[slrn][slrn] scorefile.

The code was originally written by Matthias Friedrich and posted to de.comm.software.newsreader on October 31, 2001.

I've updated it to account for API changes between S-Lang 1 and S-Lang 2.

## Usage
